A basic USB cable tester using an arduino and the [Pi Hut USB Adapter Kit](https://thepihut.com/products/usb-adapter-kit)  

Is my USB cable dead?  
Is my USB cable only for charging?  

To be sure test it.  

The USB Adapter Kit from The Pi Hut offers a full line of USB connectors male and female, each one soldered on a board with 100 mil square pins on the other side.
